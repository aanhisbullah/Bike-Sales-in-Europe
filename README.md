#Conclusion
We have done some activities in this project, such as;

Data cleaning, Data addition, Some calculations, Exploration data analysis.

Here are some findings.

Bicycle is the most popular product category. There is variation in the age group of the highest spenders in Australia, but senior citizens are generally the lowest spenders. The United States is the most profitable market for the company.
The Revenue Trend Month to date of July 2016 shows unsatisfactory results even compared to MTD July 2015 which has decreased.
This is because the bikes category product data has not been updated so that the overall revenue figure does not seem to be growing,
but keep in mind that other product categories such as accessories and clothing have decreased revenue so that future sales must be increased.
